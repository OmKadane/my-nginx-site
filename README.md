## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

This repository contains the source code for a clean, modern, and responsive static website. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate a powerful and efficient workflow for web development and deployment using **Nginx** as the web server and **Git** for version control and content synchronization.

This setup is ideal for portfolios, landing pages, and documentation sites where speed, security, and simplicity are top priorities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Nginx** (for serving the site)
* **Git** (for version control and deployment)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your server or local machine:

* **Nginx:** [Installation Guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html)
* **Git:** [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Deployment

1.  **Choose your web root directory.** For Nginx on Linux, this is typically `/var/www/html`. For our Windows setup, we used `C:\nginx\nginx-1.29.1\html`.
2.  **Clear the directory** to ensure no old files remain.
3.  **Clone the repository** directly into your web root folder. Remember to add a `.` at the end of the command to clone into the current directory.
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/OmKadane/my-nginx-site.git](https://github.com/OmKadane/my-nginx-site.git) .
    ```
4.  **Restart Nginx** to ensure the new site is served correctly.
5.  Visit your server's IP address or `http://localhost` in a browser to see the live site.
